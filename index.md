Week 1 (April 15 - April 22):

The initial proposal for our final project was first enacted on April 22. The problem we sought to solve was that of people who suffer from narcolepsy or similar obstacles and fall unconscious at unpedictable times. We wanted to improve this situation by creating a system to detect when the user falls asleep, to collect that data, and to buzz to wake them up.

Baseline Goals:

● Use a wearable sensor to determine when the user is falling asleep

● Measure when and for how long they are asleep

● Send that data to the Cloud

● Use a buzzer that receives the data and activates when the user falls asleep

Reach Goal:

● Start an app on the Samsung Galaxy Watch or some equivalent wearable device to process this data and display it graphically

Need to Learn More in Depth:

● Samsung Galaxy/Android API

● Wi-Fi/Cloud

● How to classify that a person has fallen asleep

● Photon
