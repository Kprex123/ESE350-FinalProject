Week 1 (April 15 - April 22):

The initial proposal for our final project was first enacted on April 22. The problem we sought to solve was that of people who suffer from narcolepsy or similar obstacles and fall unconscious at unpedictable times. We wanted to improve this situation by creating a system to detect when the user falls asleep, to collect that data, and to buzz to wake them up.

Baseline Goals:

● Use a wearable sensor to determine when the user is falling asleep (either breathing rate, heart rate, or head movement when the user is "nodding off")

● Measure when and for how long they are asleep

● Send that data to the Cloud (the Cloud can store data and transfer it to different platforms, like a watch)

● Use a buzzer that receives the data and activates when the user falls asleep (the buzzer will only vibrate, so no sound should be produced to reduce disruptions in quiet settings and it should not be painful)

Reach Goal:

● Start an app on the Samsung Galaxy Watch or some equivalent wearable device to process this data and display it graphically

Need to Learn More in Depth:

● Samsung Galaxy/Android API

● Wi-Fi/Cloud

● How to classify that a person has fallen asleep

● Photon

For testing, Katrina herself shall be the subject since she has severe anemia. This causes her blood cells to bind to oxygen at a lesser rate, therefore her body exhausts its energy quickly. This means she falls unconscious at unpredictable hours, making her a prime test subject.
