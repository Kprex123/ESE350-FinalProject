Week 1 (April 15 - April 22):

The initial proposal for our final project was first enacted on April 22. The problem we seeked to solve was that of people who suffer from narcolepsy or similar obstacles. We wanted to improve this situation by creating a system to detect when the user falls asleep, collect that data, and buzz to wake them up.
